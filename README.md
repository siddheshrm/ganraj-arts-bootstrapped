# Shree Ganraj Arts Studio â€“ Bootstrap Implementation

This project is a **Bootstrap-powered** recreation of my original **Shree Ganraj Arts Studio** website, now hosted on **GitHub Pages**.  
The aim was to **demonstrate Bootstrap skills** while retaining key features from the original website.

## Features

- **Bootstrap-structured layout** (instead of traditional Flexbox/Grid).
- **Responsive Portfolio Section**:
  - 1 card per slide (Mobile screens).
  - 3 cards per slide (Tablets).
  - 4 cards per slide (Laptops & Desktops).
- **Google Sheets-powered Contact Form** (retained from the original site).

## Technologies Used

- **Bootstrap 5**
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**
- **Google Sheets for Contact Form Handling**
